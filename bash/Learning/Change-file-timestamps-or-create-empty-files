# touch - Change file timestamps or create empty files
# Creates a new empty file if it doesn't exist
# Updates access and modification times if the file already exists

# Basic usage:
# touch filename
# Example: touch file.txt
# Creates 'file.txt' if it doesn't exist or updates its timestamp if it does

# Options:

# -a : Change only the access time (last read) of the file
touch -a file.txt
# Updates the access time without modifying the last modification time

# -m : Change only the modification time (last changed) of the file
touch -m file.txt
# Updates the modification time without changing the access time

# -t : Set a specific timestamp for the file
touch -t 202509151200 file.txt
# Sets the timestamp to Sep 15, 2025, 12:00

# -c : Do not create a file if it doesn't exist
touch -c file.txt
# Only updates timestamps if the file exists; does not create a new file
