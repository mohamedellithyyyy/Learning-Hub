# mv - Move or rename files and directories
# Moves a file or folder to a new location, or renames it

# Basic usage:
# mv source_file.txt destination_file.txt
# Renames source_file.txt to destination_file.txt
# or moves it to another directory if destination is a folder

# Options:

# -i : Interactive mode; asks before overwriting existing files
mv -i file.txt /path/to/destination/
# Prompts before replacing a file at the destination

# -u : Move only if the source file is newer than the destination file
mv -u file.txt /path/to/destination/
# Moves the file only if it is newer, preventing unnecessary overwrites

# -v : Verbose mode; shows which files are being moved
mv -v file.txt /path/to/destination/
# Output example: 'file.txt -> /path/to/destination/file.txt'
